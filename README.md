Market Microstructure Flow Radar

Overview

MMFR LANE 2 is a real-time crypto market observation engine designed to monitor
liquidity behavior, orderflow anomalies, and derivatives-driven market dynamics.

This project does not provide trading signals or automated execution.
It is built for market structure analysis and behavioral observation.

❌ No buy/sell signals

❌ No automated trading

Philosophy

Retail traders try to predict direction.
Institutions control liquidity.

MMFR LANE 2 focuses on where liquidity is taken, defended, or redistributed,
rather than attempting price prediction.

The core principle is simple:

Survival > Precision

Architecture

Backend

Node.js

WebSocket (Binance Futures)

REST polling (Klines, Open Interest)

Frontend

Real-time dashboard

Dual UI mode:

MASTER (data-centric)

Market Signals Observed

Liquidity Hunting

Why This Is Open Source

The purpose of this repository is study and transparency,
not edge-selling or signal distribution.

True market edges do not come from code alone —
they come from interpretation, discipline, and risk control.

Final Note

The top 1% are not those who predict correctly,
but those who avoid catastrophic mistakes.
